# reddit-twitter-NLP

The aim of this project is to extract Reddit threads and their top comments and use sentiment analysis to figure out how users feel about each thread.
For this task, we will be using the Twitter API to train the model and seeing how the model performs on the data from the Reddit API.

Tasks (Part I):
- Use the Twitter API to extract data and perform time-series analysis.
- Use the Reddit API to extract data and perform time-series analysis.

Tasks (Part II):
- Train the model on the Twitter API and try to improve the accuracy.
- Deploy the model locally using Flask

Tasks (Part III):
- Transfer the model and use it on the data from Reddit 
- How does this affect the performance of the model? Tune the model to improve accuracy on the new Reddit data.
- Train a new model on Reddit data and compare the two.
- Deploy the model using Flask and create a front-end application around it.
